<h1>So, what is Digital Enterprise Architecture</h1>

<pre>

Some time ago, I have written an article about what Digital Architecture is [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-digital-architecture-anyway-mehmet-akyuz/]. As a continuation of that article, also as apparently I am not very creative in finding new topics, I would like to focus on Digital Enterprise Architecture this time. 

The previous article presented an introduction to various levels and styles of architecture. I will not go through that introduction again but would suggest you have a look at it to appreciate the differences between Enterprise and Solution Architectures. 

The previous article stated that Digital Architecture is an architecture discipline applied to Solution Architecture. As would be expected, the same logic applies to Digital Enterprise Architecture. Digital Enterprise Architecture is essentially a modern approach to Enterprise Architecture which appreciates the impacts of digital transformation and thrives to keep the organisation stay ahead of the digital curve. 

With that said, here are the fundamental ways (approach?) to achieve Digital Enterprise Architecture.

<h2>Disrupt Enterprise Architecture Principles</h2>

<pre>

OK, disrupting might sound a bit ambitious. However, at a minimum,  Enterprise Architecture should revise architecture principles, policies and standards to enable faster adoption of digital capabilities. 

One pitfall that traditional Enterprise Architectures fall into is to define heavily engineered principles which are articulated in an academic language and often disconnected from the organisation. Such principles are highly likely to miss digital best practices which are key to digital transformation. Likewise, established policies and standards may not allow solution patterns which are virtually endemic to digital. 

In a Digital Enterprise Architecture,  principles should be simple to understand and concise with a good understanding of the digital landscape. Principles should encourage free thinking and challenging of the status quo in order the deliver better experiences. As a good example, Digital Principles [https://digitalprinciples.org/]  provides a simple set of principles with digital themes such as Designing with the User and Designing for Scale. 

Similarly, Enterprise Architects should revise policies and standards to adapt to the technology patterns which come with digital.  Many digital organisations use technologies in ways that are traditionally unacceptable. For example, data replication (before [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb245678.aspx] was considered an anti-pattern as it would lead to data inconsistencies and poor use of resources. However, today's distributed databases achieve high performance through replication and denormalisation. Similarly, testing in production............

<h2>Experience as Enterprise Architecture assets</h2> 

<pre>

Key to digital is creating the right and optimum experiences for customers. In order to model such experiences, organisations today use tools like Customer Personas, Customer Lifecycle and Journey Maps [http://beyondthearc.com/blog/2014/customer-experience/improve-customer-experience-with-personas-and-journey-maps#sthash.ynuBiWXk.dpbs]. In a Digital Enterprise Architecture, development and re-use of these experience artifacts should be considered a norm, and also enterprise versions of these assets should be provided [https://searchcio.techtarget.com/tip/Why-EA-should-take-the-lead-on-improving-customer-experience]. As an example, these could be added to the list of outputs of the Business Architecture phase where Enterprise Architecture is modelled as per TOGAF's ADM. 

These enterprise level catalogue of customer personas, lifecycle stages and high-level customer journey maps should then be used to derive other enterprise models where possible. As an example, a business capabilities maps should display critical capabilities that are necessary to implement these journeys and capabilities impacted by different customer personas and their lifecycle stages. This would allow help organisations create capabilities that connect with the customers throughout their lifecycle. Where experience artifacts cannot be directly used to derive other EA models, they should at least be associated. For example, an application catalogue linked to customer journeys would reveal critical applications for customer satisfaction.
